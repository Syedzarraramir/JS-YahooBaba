    Variables in Java Script:
</h1>
<p>
    for example i have to write My Name is Zarrar 10 times in Java Script.
</p>
<script>
    document.write("My Name is Zarrar <br>");
    document.write("My Name is Zarrar <br>");
    document.write("My Name is Zarrar <br>");
    document.write("My Name is Zarrar <br>");
    document.write("My Name is Zarrar <br>");
    document.write("My Name is Zarrar <br>");
    document.write("My Name is Zarrar <br>");
    document.write("My Name is Zarrar <br>");
    document.write("My Name is Zarrar <br>");
    document.write("My Name is Zarrar <br>");
</script>
<p>But if i need to change the message later to my name is Syed Zarrar Amir then it will be very difficult for me to go on every Zarrar and do Changes there. </p>
<script>
    var myName = "Syed Zarrar Amir";
    document.write("My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName + "<br>");

    document.write("Now if i need to change my Name only to Zarrar so i will change Varaible Value. (here 10 times are written in this format later i will do it easily through loops.)")

    var myName = "Zarrar";
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName);
    document.write("<br> My name is " + myName + "<br>");
</script>
<h1>
    To know Varaible Type.
</h1>
<script>
    var x;
    x = "My City Name";
    document.write(typeof x);
</script>

<h1>
    Contants 
</h1>
<script>
    const Country = "Pakistan";
     document.write("My Country is " + Country);
     document.write("<br> You Can Neither Change Type of Const");
     // if you will write now Country = Saudi Arabia; 
    //  so it will give error in console.
</script>
<h1>
    Let
</h1>
<p>
    In JavaScript, the let keyword is used to declare variables that are block-scoped. Unlike var, which is function-scoped, variables declared with let are only accessible within the block, loop, or expression in which they are used. This makes let useful for preventing variables from being accessed or modified outside their intended scope.
    
    Key Characteristics of let:
    Block Scope: Variables declared with let are confined to the block they are defined in (such as within {}).
    No Hoisting (like var): While var is hoisted (i.e., can be used before it's declared), let does not allow this; you must declare the variable before using it.
    Reassignment Allowed: A let variable can be reassigned new values after its declaration.
</p>
<script>
    if (true) {
    let x = 10;
    document.write(x + "<br>"); // 10
}

document.write(x); // Error: x is not
